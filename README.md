# React Book Listing App

Let's put in some practice creating a React component from scratch.

1.  Create a new React project in this repository using the command `create-react-app`.

2.  Create a `src/components/Book.js` file that exports a basic React component.

3.  Import the `Book` component in the `App.js` file, and render it in the App component's JSX.

4.  Create a `book` object in the `App` component that has the following properties:

    *   `title`
    *   `author`
    *   `author_image_url`
    *   `description`

5.  Pass the `book` object properties into the `<Book />` element as props.

6.  In the `components/Book.js` file, use the props that were passed down to the component
    to render the data into the JSX.

7.  Create another `book` object and pass its informations as props to the `<Book />` component in the App's render() method.

8. Style your book app, don't forget to use `className` instead of `class`. Your CSS styles goes into App.css.
